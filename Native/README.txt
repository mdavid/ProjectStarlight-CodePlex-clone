This solution builds all native components of the Qumu Multicast
plugin for Silverlight.  To build the NPAPI (Firefox) plugin you
must extract a copy of the XULRunner SDK in the xulrunner-sdk directory.

This solution is built using Visual Studio 2005.  It may work using later
versions of Visual Studio, but this is untested.
